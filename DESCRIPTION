Description: Using statistical decision theoretic arguments, ABC can be set up such that accuracy properties of the ABC approximation can be established without recursion to asymptotic arguments. 
Description: The idea is to construct - through statistical modelling of so-called summary values - an appropriate 
Description: parametric probability space on which the ABC approximation can be controlled. The distribution of the 
Description: summary values specifies which decision test to use. The ABC approximation to the likelihood on this 
Description: auxiliary space is the power function of the decision test. The decision tests have free parameters. 
Description: These can be calibrated so that the power function is very similar to the likelihood on the summary space. 
Description: Regularity conditions ensure that the accurate ABC approximation on the auxiliary space is also accurate 
Description: on the original parameter space. This framework is referred to as ABC.star.
Description: This package provides functions to calibrate decision tests to match the likelihood on the summary space, including the length of the simulated data set; calculate the correct tolerances to be used in conjunction with a specific test; check the regularity conditions for accurate parameter inference from ABC.star output
Description: Calibrated decision tests for ABC* based on summary values
